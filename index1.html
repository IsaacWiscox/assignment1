<h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr>PhD</abbr> (Doctor of Philosophy) next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

<h2>Starting dates</h2>

<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
      <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
    </ul>
